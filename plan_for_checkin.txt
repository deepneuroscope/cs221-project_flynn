Plan for check in:

1. Literature Review:
Add some papers here
Add some medium articles here
Maybe even some gh repos

2. Dataset
what data set are we going to use?

Probably CCRL dataset?
https://lczero.org/blog/2018/09/a-standard-dataset/

3. Baseline with be minimax as depth 1?
Also we can use a very simple eval function with just counting piece weights?

4. Minimax to highest depth possible without many second slowdowns
5. For minimax- how do we learn a better eval function?
6. Metrics
Macro: Did we win the game vs lose vs draw?
Mico: How good was our move? Consult oracle (figure out where to get an oracle)

7. Future work would be neural net with supervised learning
