Plan for check in:

1. Literature Review:
Add some papers here
Add some medium articles here
Maybe even some gh repos

2. Dataset
what data set are we going to use?

Probably CCRL dataset?

3. Baseline with be minimax as depth 1?
Also we can use a very simple eval function with just counting piece weights?

4. Minimax to highest depth possible without many second slowdowns
5. For minimax- how do we learn a better eval function?
6. Metrics
Macro: Did we win the game vs lose vs draw?
Mico: How good was our move? Consult oracle (figure out where to get an oracle)

7. Future work would be neural net with supervised learning
