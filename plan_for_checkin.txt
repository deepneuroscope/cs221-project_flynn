Plan for check in:

1. Literature Review:
Add some papers here
Add some medium articles here
Maybe even some gh repos

2. Dataset
what data set are we going to use?

Probably CCRL dataset?
https://lczero.org/blog/2018/09/a-standard-dataset/

3. Baseline with be minimax as depth 1?
Also we can use a very simple eval function with just counting piece weights?

4. Minimax to highest depth possible without many second slowdowns
5. For minimax- how do we learn a better eval function?
6. Metrics
Macro: Did we win the game vs lose vs draw?
Micro: How good was our move? Consult oracle (figure out where to get an oracle)

7. Future work would be neural net with supervised learning


Flynn:
 - figuring out how to not need to deep copy the board and also integrate moves into the current board position quickly.
 - This is important because one of the constraints on how deep we can go is processing time for a single move

Adhish:
 - Look into better evaluation functions
 - download stockfish

Seena:
 - Look into better evaluation functions
